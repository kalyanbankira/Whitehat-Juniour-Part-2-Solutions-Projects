### Instructions

#### Goal of the Project
This project is designed for you to practice and solve the activities that are based on the concepts covered in the lesson:

- Support Vector Machines - Hyperplane Visualisation I

- Support Vector Machines - Hyperplane Visualisation II

---

#### Problem Statement

In this project, you are going to revise the lesson by scatter plots using different parameters.

---

#### Getting Started:

1. Click on this link to open the Colab file for this project.

     https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DVkcNeZhGunmp3B7gEfUA0TzGWTH8CdQ  

2. Create a duplicate copy of the Colab file as described below.

  - Click on the **File menu**. A new drop-down list will appear.

   <img src='https://student-datasets-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/lesson-0/0_file_menu.png' width=500>

  - Click on the **Save a copy in Drive** option. A duplicate copy will get created. It will open up in the new tab on your web browser.

  <img src='https://student-datasets-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/lesson-0/1_create_colab_duplicate_copy.png' width=500>

3. After creating the duplicate copy of the notebook, please rename it in the **YYYY-MM-DD_StudentName_Project84** format.

4. Now, write your code in the prescribed code cells.

### Activities


**Activity 1:** Scatter Plot 1

**Activity 2:** Scatter Plot 2

**Activity 3:** Scatter Plot 3

---

#### Activity 1: Scatter Plot 1

In this acitivity you have to create a scatter plot with 10 random numbers arrays at the x-axis and y-axis. Add different values to size and colour the markers manually by creating arrays.

**Steps:**
1. Create an array `x` of 10 random integers between 1-100 for the X-axis.
2.Create an array `y` of 10 random integers between 101-1000 for the Y-axis.
3. Create an array for 10 marker sizes `sizes` from 10 to 100 such that the difference between two consecutive numbers is 10.
4. Create an array of 10 different colours `colors`. For example:
```
["red","green","blue","yellow","pink","black","orange","purple","magenta","brown"]
```
5. Plot the scatter plot with all four parameters `x`, `y`, `c`, and `s`.
6. Display the graph.

#### Activity 2: Scatter Plot 2

In this activity you have to create a scatter plot with 10 random numbers arrays at the x-axis and y-axis. And colour the marker with different shades from the rainbow palette using `cmap='rainbow'` by creating arrays.

**Steps:**
1. Create an array `x` of 10 random integers between 1-100 for the X-axis.
2. Create an array `y` of 10 random integers between 101-1000 for the Y-axis.
3. Create an array for 10 different shades of colour from 10 to 100 such that the difference between two consecutive numbers is 10.
4. Plot the scatter plot with parameters `x`, `y`, `c`, and `cmap`.
5. Display the colorbar.
6. Display the graph.

---

#### Activity 3: Scatter Plot 3

In this acitivity you have to create a scatter plot with 20 random numbers arrays at the x-axis and y-axis. Also, the 20 numbers will be divided into 4 labels `1`, `2`, `3`,  and `4` randomly. Add colour to the marker which will differentiate them according to the label. Add different shades from the dark palette using `cmap='Dark2'` by creating arrays.


**Steps:**
1. Create an array `x` of 20 random integers between 1-100 for the X-axis.
2. Create an array `y` of 20 random integers between 101-1000 for the Y-axis.
3. Create an array of 20 random integers for labels between range 1-4.
4. Plot the scatter plot with parameters `x`, `y`, `c`, and `cmap`.
5. Display the colorbar.
