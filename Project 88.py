### Instructions

#### Goal of the Project
This project is designed for you to practice and solve the activities that are based on the concepts covered in the following lessons:

  1. Internet Advertisement Classification.

---

#### Getting Started:

1. Click on this link to open the Colab file for this project.

     https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mHAUxfohlSzh7RxoDgrnlbM9oNiMQCer  

2. Create a duplicate copy of the Colab file as described below.

  - Click on the **File menu**. A new drop-down list will appear.

#### Problem Statement

In this project, you are going to revise the lesson by dataset cleaning activities using a dummy dataset.

---

### List of Activities

**Activity 1:** Load the Dummy Dataset

**Activity 2:**  Data Conversion

**Activity 3:**  Data Cleaning

---

#### Activity 1:  Load the Dummy Dataset

**1.** Create a Pandas DataFrame for the dummy dataset using the below link. This dataset consists of the following 4 columns (numeric values) and 30 rows:


  **Dataset Link:** https://s3-student-datasets-bucket.whjr.online/whitehat-ds-datasets/dummy_data88.csv

**2.** Print the first five rows of the dataset:
"""

# Load the dummy dataset into a DataFrame
# Import all the libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('https://s3-student-datasets-bucket.whjr.online/whitehat-ds-datasets/dummy_data88.csv')
df.head()

"""**2.** Print the information of the DataFrame:"""

# Print the DataFrame information
df.info()

"""**Q:** What is the data type of all the columns?

**A:** `Object data type ` of all the columns.

---

**3.** Check for the null values in the DataFrame:
"""

# Check for the missing values in each column in the data frame.
df.isnull().sum()

"""**Q.** Are there any missing values in the DataFrame?

**A.** `NO` there is no any missing values in the DataFrame.

**After this activity, the DataFrame should be created from the dummy dataset.**

---

#### Activity 2:  Data Conversion

In this activity, you have to try to convert the data type of the columns from **object** to **numeric** using the `to_numeric()` function of the `pandas` module.

**1.** Call the `apply()` function on the `DataFrame` object.

**2.** Inside the `apply()` function, pass `pandas.to_numeric` as an input:
"""

# Try to convert the columns from object to numeric data type
df = df.apply(pd.to_numeric)

"""**Q:** What is the output of the `to_numeric()` function?

**A:** The output of the `to_numeric()` is `value error`.

**Q:** What is the unwanted value string noted in the error?

**A:** The unwanted value string noted in the error is `Unable to parse string "  ?" at position 6`.

---

**3.**  Create a function `unwanted_values_finder()` to find the unwanted string values using the steps below.


**Steps (learned in Lesson 88: Internet Advertisement Classification - Activity 2 ):**
<p>

**i.** Create a `unwanted_values_finder()` function with an unwanted search string as input parameter.
  
**ii.** Create an empty list to store the name of the columns having unwanted values.

**iii.** Run a `for` loop for all the columns:

  - Inside the `for` loop check presence of the the unwanted string using the `if` condition and `np.sum()` function.

  - If the unwanted string is present in a particular column, append the name of the column to the empty list created.

**iv.** Return the list which stores the columns having unwanted values.

</p>
"""

# Create the 'unwanted_values_finder()' function.
def unwanted_values_finder(u):
    emp_list = []
    for i in df.columns:
        if np.sum(df[i] == u )> 0:
            emp_list.append(i)
    return emp_list

"""**4.** Call the `unwanted_values_finder()` function and pass the unwanted string as the parameter:"""

# Call the function to find the columns with unwanted string
unwanted_values_finder("  ?")

"""**Q:** Write the name of columns with unwanted values.

**A:** The name of columns with unwanted values is column 'A' and 'D'.

---

**5.** Other than the columns found above, try to convert rest of the columns:
"""

# Try to convert the columns not having unwanted values from object to numeric data type
df[['B','C']].apply(pd.to_numeric)

"""**Q:** What is the output of the `to_numeric()` function?

**A:** The output of the `to_numeric()` function is
ValueError: Unable to parse string "  ? ".

**Q:** What is the unwanted value string noted in the error?

**A:**  The unwanted value string noted in the error is Unable to parse string "  ? " at position 9 .

---

**6.** Call the `unwanted_values_finder()` function and pass the unwanted string as the parameter:
"""

# Call the function to find the columns with unwanted string
unwanted_values_finder("  ? ")

"""**Q:** Write the name of columns with unwanted values.

**A:** The name of columns with unwanted values is columns 'B' & 'C'.

**Q:** How many columns in total have unwanted value strings?

**A:** Two

---

**After this activity, the unwanted string values should be identified for their respective columns**

----

#### Activity 3:  Data Cleaning

In this activity, you have to remove the unwanted value strings from the columns and convert them to numeric.

**1.** Remove the rows from the columns `"A"` and `"D"` with unwanted values in them:
"""

# Remove all the rows containing question marks in both "A" and "D" columns
df = df[df['A']!="  ?"]
df = df[df['D']!="  ?"]
df

"""**Hint:** Use the DataFrame conditional statements on columns to remove the unwanted values from the columns

**2.** Remove the rows from the columns `"B"` and `"C"` with unwanted values in them:
"""

# Remove all the rows containing question marks in both "B" and "C" columns
df = df[df['B']!="  ? "]
df = df[df['C']!="  ? "]
df

"""**3.** Print the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame after removing unwanted values:"""

# Print the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame.
print(df.shape)

"""**Q:** How many rows are deleted after data cleaning?

**A:**  There are 19 rows and 4 columns  after data cleaning.

**5.** Convert the columns of DataFrame into numeric:
"""

# Convert the columns of DataFrame to numeric
df = df.apply(pd.to_numeric)

"""**6.** Print the information of the DataFrame to verify the data type of columns:"""

# Print the information of the DataFrame.
df.info()

"""**Q.** What is the data type of the columns?

**A.** `Float` is the data type of all columns.

**After this activity, the DataFrame should be cleaned and the columns data type should be numeric.**

**Write your interpretation of the results here.**
